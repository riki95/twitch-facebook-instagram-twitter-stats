[![HitCount](http://hits.dwyl.io/riki95/twitch-facebook-instagram-twitter-stats.svg)](http://hits.dwyl.io/riki95/twitch-facebook-instagram-twitter-stats)

Script that is able to interact with Twitch API to get Followers Count, Viewers Count and other info basing on a given list of Usernames.

## Getting Started

Download the repo:

```
git clone https://github.com/riki95/twitch-facebook-instagram-twitter-stats
```
Open the project and create a **secrets.py** file. 
Inside of it, fill it basing on the type of social you want to get stats.
Copy and paste this and fill it:
```
client_id_TW = ''
OAuth_TW = ''

client_id_IG = ''
token_IG = ''

client_id_FB = ''
token_FB = ''
```

Twitter still must be implemented.
